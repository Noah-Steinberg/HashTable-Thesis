# Hash Tables
This project is an implementation of various hash table techniques with various customizations. 
Overall this project has a focus on comparing many different techniques, rather than perfect implementation.
This means some sacrifices were made in order to improve the customization of the hash tables. 
However, each hash table should be affected equally by the changes, minimizing any unfairness.
